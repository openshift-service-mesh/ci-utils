# Code Review

You are orchestrating a code review pipeline. Follow these steps exactly.

> **CRITICAL: NEVER post public comments to GitHub without explicit user approval.**
> - NEVER use `event="COMMENT"` or `event="REQUEST_CHANGES"` in API calls
> - NEVER use `gh pr review --comment` or `gh pr comment` directly
> - ALWAYS create PENDING reviews by omitting the `event` field
> - ALWAYS get explicit user confirmation before running any `gh` command

## Structured Issue IDs

Every finding in the pipeline must be assigned a structured ID for easy reference:

| Prefix | Category | Assigned By |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `BUG-N` | Bugs (logic, correctness, crashes) | adversarial-reviewer |
| `SEC-N` | Security vulnerabilities | adversarial-reviewer |
| `STY-N` | Style / convention violations | style-reviewer |
| `TST-N` | Testing gaps or quality issues | testing-reviewer |
| `IMP-N` | General improvements | any phase |

Numbers are sequential within each prefix. During consolidation, IDs are finalized and deduplicated findings keep the lowest assigned ID.

## Phase Transitions

| Transition | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| **Step 0 → Step 1** | Automatic. |
| **Step 1 → Step 2** | Automatic (if setup guard passes). |
| **Step 2 → Step 3** | Automatic (if triage finds changes). |
| **Step 3 → Step 4** | Automatic (after all subagents return). |
| **Step 4 → Step 5** | Automatic. |
| **Step 5 → Step 6** | Automatic. |
| **Step 6 → Step 7** | **Wait for user.** Present findings, ask if user wants the report written to disk. Wait for user response before continuing. |
| **Step 7 → Step 8** | **Only if user requests.** Do NOT offer unprompted. If user says "create PR review", "post to GitHub", or similar, proceed — but confirm before executing any `gh` command. |
| **Step 7 → Step 9** | Automatic after user responds to findings. |

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO THESE)

| NEVER | INSTEAD |
|-------|---------|
| Post comments to GitHub without explicit user confirmation | Ask the user, wait for "yes", then create pending review |
| Use `event="COMMENT"` in gh api calls | Omit `event` field entirely for pending reviews |
| Use `gh pr review --comment` | Use `gh api` with no `event` field |
| Create individual comments via `/pulls/{id}/comments` | Use `/pulls/{id}/reviews` with `comments` array |
| Write report to disk without asking | Ask the user first, write only if confirmed |
| Skip phases to "save time" | Follow all phases in order |

## Step 0: Parse Arguments

Check if a specific phase was requested:
- `/code-reviewer:review` — run all three phases
- `/code-reviewer:review:adversarial` — run adversarial phase only
- `/code-reviewer:review:style` — run style phase only
- `/code-reviewer:review:testing` — run testing phase only

## Step 1: Setup Guard

Check that the project has been onboarded:
1. Check if `.code-reviewer/config.md` exists
2. If not, fall back to `.claude/code-reviewer/config.md` (legacy path)
3. Check if the corresponding `reference/` directory exists with at least one `.md` file

Use whichever path has the config. If both exist, prefer `.code-reviewer/`. Throughout this document, `{config_dir}` refers to the resolved path.

If neither location has these files, stop and tell the user:
> "No project configuration found. Run `/code-reviewer:setup` first to analyze your codebase and generate reference docs. Without this, reviews won't have project-specific context for style and testing conventions."

Do not proceed with the review.

## Step 2: Triage

Invoke the triage skill to analyze the diff and build review briefs.

The triage skill will:
1. Capture the diff (current branch vs. base branch)
2. Load the project config and reference docs
3. Group changes into review units
4. Produce unit-scoped briefs and a full-scope brief

If triage reports no changes, tell the user and stop.

## Step 3: Dispatch Review Subagents

Based on the command argument:

**If `/code-reviewer:review` (all phases):**
Dispatch all three agents **in parallel** using the Agent tool. Pass the brief as the agent's prompt content — the brief IS the message the subagent receives. Include the reference doc content inline in the prompt so the subagent has everything it needs.

Example dispatch (conceptual):
- Agent tool → `adversarial-reviewer` subagent type, prompt = full-scope brief + all reference doc contents
- Agent tool → `style-reviewer` subagent type, prompt = unit-scoped brief + style guide content
- Agent tool → `testing-reviewer` subagent type, prompt = unit-scoped brief + testing practices content

For multiple review units, dispatch one style-reviewer and one testing-reviewer per unit, all in parallel.

**If `/code-reviewer:review:adversarial`:**
Dispatch only the `adversarial-reviewer` agent with the full-scope brief as its prompt.

**If `/code-reviewer:review:style`:**
For each review unit, dispatch the `style-reviewer` agent with the unit-scoped brief as its prompt.

**If `/code-reviewer:review:testing`:**
For each review unit, dispatch the `testing-reviewer` agent with the unit-scoped brief as its prompt.

## Step 4: Consolidation

After all subagents return, invoke the consolidation skill to:
1. Collect all phase reports
2. Assign final structured IDs (BUG-N, SEC-N, STY-N, TST-N, IMP-N)
3. Deduplicate findings (keep lowest ID when merging)
4. Surface cross-unit issues
5. Produce the final consolidated report with verdict

## Step 5: Self-Validation

Immediately after consolidation, perform a validation pass on every finding:

1. **Re-examine each finding** — Go back to the code and verify the issue is real
2. **Trace context** — For each finding, check:
   - How the code is actually called (trace callers)
   - Whether the issue is handled elsewhere (e.g., validation at a different layer)
   - Whether the pattern is intentional design
   - Related code in other files that might resolve the concern
3. **Check for common false positives:**
   - "Security issues" that require pre-existing vulnerabilities to exploit
   - "Missing validation" when validation happens at a different layer (e.g., Kubernetes API, framework middleware)
   - "Race conditions" in code paths that are actually serialized
   - "Missing features" that are intentionally out of scope
   - "Unused code" that is used via reflection, generics, or external calls
   - "Style violations" for patterns the project intentionally deviates from
4. **Remove false positives** — Drop any finding confirmed as invalid after deeper analysis
5. **Adjust severity** — Downgrade or upgrade findings based on the wider context discovered

Do NOT present intermediate results. Continue directly to Step 6.

## Step 6: Present Findings

Present the validated, consolidated report to the user.

After presenting, ask:
> "Would you like me to write this report to a file?"

- If the user confirms, write the report as a markdown file at the workspace root (e.g., `review-<branch_name>.md`)
- If the user declines or doesn't respond, continue without writing

Wait for the user to respond before continuing.

## Step 7: Post-Review Discussion

The user may:
- Ask for details on specific findings by ID (e.g., "explain BUG-3")
- Disagree with findings — remove them if the user's reasoning is sound
- Ask follow-up questions about the code
- Request the report written to disk (if they didn't in Step 6)

After the user has addressed the findings, invoke the doc-update skill to consider whether reference docs need updating based on the discussion.

The user can re-run `/code-reviewer:review` to verify fixes.

## Step 8: GitHub PR Review Creation (Optional)

> **Only enter this step if the user explicitly requests it** (e.g., "create PR review", "post comments to GitHub", "add review to the PR").

Before executing any `gh` command, confirm with the user:
> "I'll create a **pending** GitHub review with N comments on PR #X. The review will NOT be public until you manually submit it on GitHub. Proceed?"

Wait for explicit confirmation. If the user says yes:

### Pre-Flight Checklist

Verify ALL of the following before proceeding:
- [ ] User explicitly confirmed PR review creation
- [ ] Report has been reviewed by user in Steps 6-7
- [ ] Will use `gh api` with NO `event` field (creates PENDING review)
- [ ] Will NOT use `gh pr review --comment` or `gh pr comment`

### Create Pending Review

```bash
cat << 'REVIEW_EOF' | gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr_number>/reviews --method POST --input -
{
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "path/to/file.go",
      "line": 123,
      "body": "**BUG-1: <Title>**\n\n<Description>\n\n**Severity: Critical**"
    },
    {
      "path": "path/to/another/file.ts",
      "line": 45,
      "body": "**SEC-1: <Title>**\n\n<Description>\n\n**Severity: Important**"
    }
  ]
}
REVIEW_EOF
```

For multi-repo PRs, create separate pending reviews per repository.

### After Creating Pending Reviews

> "I've created pending review(s) for:
> - `<owner>/<repo>#<pr>`: N comments
>
> **These are NOT public until you submit them.**
>
> To submit: go to the PR on GitHub → 'Files changed' tab → 'Pending review' button → review comments → 'Submit review'.
>
> You can edit or delete any comments before submitting."

### GitHub Safety Notes
- **Omit the `event` field** to keep the review PENDING
- Use `--paginate` when fetching PR files if there are many
- Line numbers must be lines that are part of the diff (added/modified lines)
- For new files, line numbers correspond directly to the file
- Only include comments for files that exist in that specific PR

## Step 9: Doc Update

After the user has responded to findings in Step 7, invoke the doc-update skill to consider whether reference docs need updating. This step is automatic — no user prompt needed to enter it.

## Important Notes

- Do NOT skip the triage step, even for single-phase reviews — subagents need the structured brief
- Do NOT modify any code during the review — this pipeline only analyzes and reports
- If a subagent fails, include what you have and note the gap in the consolidated report
- Every finding MUST have a structured ID and a `file:line` reference
- Code snippets are optional but encouraged when they help explain the issue
